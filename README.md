# toDoListPro
G00299627-Mobile App-Development Project

My Application is a simple to use To-Do List app.
User enters task on the To-Do tabs that they wish to do
This task is then added to a checkbox list on the List Tab
User can check the checkbox when they are finsihed there to-do task
User can active a delete toggle which allows them to delete whatever task they wish
NOTE: I was unable to get the delete button to work fully, I tried many different things,
but I was unsuccessful with my efforts. The button does however delete the task name,
date and time it was added but not the whole checkbox.
